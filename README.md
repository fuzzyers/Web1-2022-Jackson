## Kokako Assesment Website
### This Website Design has Been Tested On
- Google
- FireFox
- Edge
- Opera GX (Slight Diffrence)

This project has been undertaken using pure Html, Css and Javascript as learning experience and a first steps into webdevelopment.
> It has been designed from the New Zealand Coffee distributer Kokakos Website https://www.kokako.co.nz/ 
With the idea of using and learning diffrent advanced concepts used in the making of the website.
Some of these more advanced features include but are not limited to
- Sliding Panels
- Text that appears on hover
- Grid Structuring
- Paralax effect

An early challenge on the website came from fitting the images to the page due to the strange layout in the intial area of the website.
At the same time I was also struggling with the implmentation of a Nav bar which has seen a number of reworks since its inital implementation and is still to recieve some more working the case of adding responsive layout for a phone friendly view.
The current challenge is the Sliding panels while I have an understanding of how to do it i think it will provide an interesting challenge in implementation.
Along With I have yet to add a paralax effect which will be important as to complete one of my goals.

## Bugs
### Css
- Coffee Mug When hovering over Extends to far.
- Text Animation isnt perfectly synced.
- Paralax Effect should be less subtle.
- Rolling Door Hover Effect on Banners having issues with the text.
- Rolling Door Contents 2 Not correctly Displaying.
- Issue Resposive Not displaying Hamburger Icon
### Js
- When Hovering over Shop dropdown it will not close until you hover over inside of the dropdown.

## Future Additions
### Responsive
- Nav Bar
> The Navbar Requires a design which will hide all tokens on the navbar except for the cart item counter and search icon and replace them with a Hamburger on the Left
along with replacing the Kokako Text Title with the Kokako Favicon as the home Button.
- Future Segment
> The Future Segement Image needs to scale back and obtain a margin in the box.
- Coffee Icon
> The Coffee Icon hovering on the page needs some nicer styling to it.
- Featured Goods
> Needs Redesigned for in reponsive so the shop items display in a column opposed to a row.
- Roller Door
> Roller door needs to display in column opposed to in row.
