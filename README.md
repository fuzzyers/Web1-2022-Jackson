## Kokako Assesment Website

This project has been undertaken using pure Html, Css and Javascript as learning experience and a first steps into webdevelopment.
> It has been designed from the New Zealand Coffee distributer Kokakos Website https://www.kokako.co.nz/ 
With the idea of using and learning diffrent advanced concepts used in the making of the website.
Some of these more advanced features include but are not limited to
- Sliding Panels
- Text that appears on hover
- Grid Structuring
- Paralax effect

An early challenge on the website came from fitting the images to the page due to the strange layout in the intial area of the website.
At the same time I was also struggling with the implmentation of a Nav bar which has seen a number of reworks since its inital implementation and is still to recieve some more working the case of adding responsive layout for a phone friendly view.
The current challenge is the Sliding panels while I have an understanding of how to do it i think it will provide an interesting challenge in implementation.
Along With I have yet to add a paralax effect which will be important as to complete one of my goals.
